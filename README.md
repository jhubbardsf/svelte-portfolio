# SvelteKit + FireBase Example App
This is a app showing different SvelteKite and FireBase functionality. Currently showing SvelteKit + FireBase authentication with email and google authentication. Several example apps which keep state are available on login. More will be added in the feature and will continue refactoring to DRY code and keep SvelteKit best practices.

## Live Example app
Check app out here at the [live preview](https://josh-sveltekit.netlify.app/).
Hosted on [netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Running locally

If you want to try running it locally you'll need to create a firebase account, create a new web project, and enable authentication for email and google (more authentication methods coming later).
